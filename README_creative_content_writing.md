# README: Creative Writing Group

## Overview
Welcome to the Creative Writing Group! Our mission is to infuse AI systems with lively, engaging, and human-like responses by leveraging creative writing techniques. This project focuses on generating unique, realistic, and dynamic queries for an AI receptionist. These queries will serve as training data for the LLM (Large Language Model) team, ensuring the AI receptionist can respond in a friendly, conversational, and professional manner.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a robust set of diverse and contextually rich queries that the AI receptionist can encounter in real-world scenarios. These queries will enable the LLM team to:

1. Fine-tune the AI's conversational abilities.
2. Develop vibrant and context-aware responses.
3. Improve the overall user experience by making the AI feel approachable and human-like.

## How We Generated the Queries
The process of generating queries was both structured and creative, incorporating the following steps:

### 1. **Brainstorming Common Scenarios**
   - We began by identifying common interactions that users might have with an AI receptionist, such as inquiries about password resets, campus facilities, or technical support.
   - We categorized these scenarios into broader themes: IT Support, Academic Assistance, Facility Management, and General Queries.

### 2. **Adding a Human Touch**
   - To ensure the AI responses feel natural, we crafted queries that reflect human emotions, tone, and variety.
   - Example: Instead of a straightforward query like *"How do I reset my password?",* we included more nuanced versions like *"I can’t log into my account—can you help?"*

### 3. **Incorporating Diversity**
   - We created queries from multiple perspectives (students, faculty, staff) to represent a wide range of user interactions.
   - Each query was written with unique phrasing and intent to prevent repetitive training data.

### 4. **Ensuring Relevance**
   - Queries were tailored to specific use cases for the AI receptionist, such as handling campus-specific issues (Wi-Fi connectivity, LMS login problems) and general tech support needs.

### 5. **Peer Review**
   - Every query was reviewed by team members to ensure it met our standards for clarity, creativity, and relevance.
   - Suggestions were incorporated to enhance the quality and realism of the queries.

## How the Queries Will Be Used

The queries we generated will be passed on to the LLM team, who will:

1. **Train the AI Receptionist**
   - The queries will be integrated into the training dataset, helping the AI understand various ways users might phrase questions or requests.

2. **Enhance Conversational Dynamics**
   - By exposing the AI to lively, human-like queries, the LLM will fine-tune the model to respond in a warm, engaging tone.

3. **Simulate Real-World Interactions**
   - The queries will simulate realistic interactions, enabling the AI to adapt to a variety of conversational styles and scenarios.

4. **Test and Validate Responses**
   - The queries will also serve as test cases to evaluate the AI's ability to handle diverse questions with accurate and satisfying answers.

## Future Scope
- **Expanding Query Categories:** We plan to include additional categories like mental health support, campus navigation, and event management.
- **Interactive Testing:** Partnering with the LLM team to test the AI receptionist in live scenarios and iterating on the responses.
- **Feedback Loop:** Collecting user feedback to identify gaps and refine both the queries and the AI’s responses.

## Contribution Guidelines
If you'd like to contribute:
1. Follow the established format for creating queries.
2. Ensure all queries are contextually relevant and creatively written.
3. Submit your contributions for peer review before final approval.
